# W&M Undergraduate vs Graduate Enrollment Trends

**Overview**

For my Spring 2023 Data Visualization course, we were tasked with creating an interactive Tableau dashboard, visualizing 
trends in undergraduate enrollment at William & Mary. Using data shared from the Provost, Peggy Agouris, we used this graphical user interface 
to visually analyze these trends, including total enrollment over time along with the distribution of
degrees granted by academic area and/or majors and minors. 

Apart from the baseline assignment, we had the option to create an additional dashboard(s) further exploring different trends for the College.
I created a Tableau Story, which combines dashboards and visualizations to produce a narrative, that compares the enrollment and area of study
trends between undergraduate and graduate students. Along with making the product public, my Story was also featured on the institutional website.
