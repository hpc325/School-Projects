# School Projects

This respository contains academic projects completed during my time at William & Mary.

**Current Projects in Repository**:
  1. William & Mary Undergraduate v Graduate Enrollment Analysis: 
      - Tableau Story that visualizes the differences in trends between undergraduate and graduate students at William & Mary
  2. Debunking Hollywood:
      - Our team of 4 conducted an original analysis of the collaboration patterns between directors and crew members in Hollywood. This repository only includes our final Markdown report (which has numerous Python code snippets and visualizations), but not the Python scripts and files underlying the project.
